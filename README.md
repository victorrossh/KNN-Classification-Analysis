# KNN Classification Models

This repository contains Python code for comparing different classification models using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The project was an exercise assigned by my professor at university, and it includes the implementation and evaluation of various classifiers on a dataset.

## **Files**
**Knn_1.py**: This script implements three classification models: Logistic Regression, KNN, and Decision Tree. It trains these models on the dataset, evaluates their performance, and compares their accuracies and classification errors.

**Knn_2.py**: This script focuses on the KNN classifier, testing different values for n_neighbors to determine the optimal number of neighbors. It calculates classification errors for each value of k and plots a graph to visualize the results.

**Case_cobranca.csv**: This dataset was provided by my professor for study purposes and contains fictitious data. It includes features such as age, number of debts, and client type.

## **Instructions** 
Install the required packages using pip:
`pip install numpy pandas`
`pip install --upgrade scikit-learn`

**Note**: scikit-learn might need to be installed or updated to the latest version.

## **Images** 

The Knn_2.py script will open a graph similar to the one shown below:

Review the results and analysis in the output of the scripts.
