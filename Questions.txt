THEORY
---------------
Question 1: Does the KNN algorithm generate a model? Explain how the implementation of this technique would work in a real operation (production).
Question 2: Research what other distances can be used in KNN. Show the formula(s).
Question 3: How would you perform regression to estimate a presumed income (R$) using KNN? Explain.

PRACTICE
---------------
Create two Python files: Knn_1.py and Knn_2.py to read the Case_cobranca.csv file that was provided to you (student). 
Implement the following machine learning models and perform the necessary operations to compare the accuracy and classification error of the models.
Use the parameter random_state = and set its value using the last 3 digits of your student ID (without leading zeros).

In Knn_1.py, create three different classifiers: Logistic Regression, KNN, and Decision Tree.
Train the models, compare their accuracy and classification errors, and justify which model offers the best performance.
---------------
In Knn_2.py, create a KNN classifier, varying the number of neighbors (n_neighbors).
Calculate the classification error for different values of k and plot a graph to choose the k value that generates the lowest error.

Questions:
---------------
Question 1: Run the Python code Knn_1.py and justify which is the best model for classification.
Question 2: Run the Python code Knn_2.py and justify which is the best k (n_neighbors) value for your test sample.
